Better than Freddy?
==================

A website to answer an age-old question - "Is that movie better or worse than Freddy Got Fingered?"

It uses the [Rotten Tomatoes API](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/page) and some super sophisticated math (averages) to figure out if the movie specified by a user is better or worse than Tom Green's 2001 film [Fraddy Got Fingered](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/freddy_got_fingered).

This is the result of a conversation amongst friends on trying to find a benchmark for whether or not a movie is watchable.
